 Here are some actionable recommendations based on the insights from your Tunia Technology Sales Dashboard that you can include in your GitHub, portfolio, or project summary:
## Recommendations
**Focus on Technology Sales:
Technology contributes the highest portion of sales (37%). Consider investing more in marketing and expanding inventory in this category.
**Re-evaluate Low-Profit Products:
Products like the Bush Advantage Collection Table and Cubify CubeX Printers consistently generate low or negative profit. Discontinue or renegotiate supplier pricing for these items.
**Target High-Value Customers:
Customers like Adrian Barton and Hunter Lopez show high purchase value. Consider offering loyalty programs or personalized discounts to retain them.
**Optimize Discounts:
The Binders and Phones subcategories received the highest discounts. Assess whether these discounts are necessary or if they’re reducing profitability without boosting volume.
**Boost Sales in Low-Performing Segments:
The Home Office segment generated the least profit. Targeted promotions or bundled offers could help improve its performance.
**Capitalize on Peak Months:
Sales peak in November and December—leverage this trend with early holiday promotions and stock optimization.
